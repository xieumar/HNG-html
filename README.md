* Live “fun fact” displaying milliseconds since 1970
* Dedicated **About** page with goals and future note
* **Contact Me** page with accessible form validation and success/error feedback

## **Getting Started**

### Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xieumar/hng-profile-card.git
```

### Open the project folder

```bash
cd profile-card
```

---

## **How to Run the Project**

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or use **Live Server** in VS Code for instant updates:

```bash
npx live-server
```

Navigate through the website using:

* `index.html` → Home/Profile Card
* `about.html` → About Page
* `contact.html` → Contact Me Page

---

## **How It Works**

* The **profile card** highlights the user’s name, description, and social links with subtle animations.
* The **About page** introduces goals, ambitions, and future plans with a soft glassmorphism backdrop.
* The **Contact page** features a live form with input validation, accessibility attributes, and a success message upon submission.
* Background visuals use custom blob SVGs and responsive scaling for a modern aesthetic.

---

## **Future Improvements**

* Add theme toggle (light/dark mode)
* Integrate a backend to handle contact form submissions
* Include a “Projects” section to showcase work
