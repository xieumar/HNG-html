                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>I'm Jane Bird, a driven computer engineering student with a lot of passion for technology,
                    innovation, and creativity. I see engineering as more than just circuits and code. It's a medium for
                    turning bold ideas into real-world impact. From crafting clean, responsive web applications to
                    exploring the depths of robotics and networking, I thrive on building things that not only work but
                    make an impact. Every challenge is a new opportunity to learn, push boundaries, and redefine what's
                    possible.</p>

                <h3>Areas of Low Confidence</h3>
                <p>
                    I sometimes doubt my progress and worry about not knowing enough, especially when tackling
                    unfamiliar concepts or new technologies.
                    <br>However, I try to see these moments as part of the learning curve and it reminds me that growth takes time
                    and persistence.
                    <br>I'm learning to be patient with myself, stay consistent, and trust that confidence builds with
                    experience.
